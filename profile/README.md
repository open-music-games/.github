<p>This is the official GitHub organization of Open Music Games.org - the central hub of open music games started in 2022!</p>

<p>We communicate the whole ecosystem around UltraStar Deluxe Games, Vocaluxe and Performous for players. But we help developers too. For instance by doing project management, non-profit-marketing and human ressources.
  Our main goals are:</p>
  
- strenghten the co-working between the projects,
- setting professional standards,
- trying to help all projects and players to follow legal requirements
- and enable the programmers/artists to bring up complete games.
