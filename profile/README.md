## Welcome!
This is the official GitHub Organization of Open Music Games.org - the central hub of open music games! Started in 2022! We communicate the whole ecosytem around UltraStar Deluxe Games, Vocaluxe and Performous. Our main goal is to strenghten the co-working between the projects and enable the devs to bring up complete games.
